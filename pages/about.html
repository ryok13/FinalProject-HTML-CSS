            <h3>Our story</h3>
            <p>Georgian Retro Games began as a passion project. Our founder, a lifelong gamer, discovered their childhood Game Boy tucked away in storage one winter. Turning it on after years, they were transported back to the simpler times of 8-bit adventures and endless hours spent with classics like Super Mario Land and Pokémon Red.</p>

            <p>The joy of reliving those memories sparked an idea: what if this nostalgia could be shared with others? This passion grew into a mission to make the Nintendo Game Boy accessible to both seasoned retro gamers and those discovering it for the first time.</p>

            <p>Georgian Retro Games wishes to become place made to further connect people with the industry of gaming, as well as connect them with the past this industry has, and the development it's had progressively along the years. Our promise is to further improve the accessibility of the people when it comes to obtaining these kinds of consoles, which have become so rare as time went on.</p>
            <p>We also promise to help people connect with the history of gaming from it's very core, it's ups and downs, and it's evolution throughout the years. We also wish to bring back memories to those who have experienced these consoles before, and wish to own one again, making it simpler than ever, and much cheaper as well, since we are well aware of how expensive obtaining retro games and consoles can get due to their rarity.</p>
